            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Introducing eating better, feels better.
                As college students we find ourselves neglecting our nutrition and the importance of our health.
                Our years in higher education has become a place of unorganized planning relating to nutrition and fitness.
                This uncertainty around knowing the food we consume and the amount of it , creates an unhealthy lifestyle that is not sustainable long term.
                For this project, we know that there are alot of websites that specialize in calorie tracking and fitness planning.
                But the problem rises when highlighting the users targeted for these websites.
                Most of the websites are geared towards more experienced audiences that usually have a background in calorie tracking as well as fitness planning.
                We want to change that. We want to create a space that simplifies tracking of food consumed, as well as the goals created alongside the fitness plan that parallels it.
                An existing website that addresses our problem is a regular <a href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html">calorie tracker</a>, this website addresses the tracking of calories but the interface is heavily reliant on the user's knowledge and ability to track and input values.
                We want to use the positives that come from the calorie tracker and add onto it an experience that leaves users with digestible information that they can make planned progress with.
