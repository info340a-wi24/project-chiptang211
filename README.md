# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

Our Fitness and Food Nutrition web app is primarily designed for individuals who are keen on monitoring their daily calorie intake and strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This app is particularly beneficial for those who aim to manage their weight, fitness enthusiasts, and people with specific dietary requirements or health conditions that necessitate careful food and activity tracking.
