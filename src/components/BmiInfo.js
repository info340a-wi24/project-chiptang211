Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity a week, combined with muscle-strengthening exercises on two or more days a week. Reducing portion sizes, eating whole foods, and consulting a healthcare provider or dietitian can also support weight loss efforts.`,

    'Obesity': `Obesity is a condition that significantly increases your risk of various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers. Achieving and maintaining a healthier weight is crucial for your overall health. Consider consulting a healthcare provider to discuss a weight loss plan tailored to your needs, which may include dietary changes, increased physical activity, behavior changes, or even medical treatments. Support from a multidisciplinary team including dietitians, physical therapists, and mental health professionals can be very helpful in your journey towards a healthier weight.`
